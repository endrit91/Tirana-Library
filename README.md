# Tirana-Library  link: http://endritgjeta.com/tirana_library/public/ 
This is my ongoing personal project to test my PHP, Mysql &amp; Bootstrap skills.
It has a CMS for the admins in which they can change the content, store, change and retrieve information in the database etc. 
change the apearance of the website. 
For the users-> stores record details of the orders of books, based on users accounts.
I will add other features to make it more complete.
